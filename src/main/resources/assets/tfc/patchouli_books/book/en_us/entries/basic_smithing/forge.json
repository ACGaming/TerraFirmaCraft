However, unlike the pit kiln, the sides must be made out of some kind of stone. This could be raw stone, cobblestone, smooth stone, or stone bricks. The blocks don't have to match. Right click to place 7 $(item)charcoal$() in the hole, then light it with your firestarter."

The top slots are for heating items, typically ingots or vessels. The right side is for molds or vessels to catch melting things, but this is typically only used in emergencies."
