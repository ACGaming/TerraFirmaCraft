Once you put a heated metal item in the input slot, you'll be able to click on it and select a plan for what you want to make. Then, a series of three instructions will appear at the top of the screen. These represent the last three $(thing)techniques$() that you must use, in order."

Different techniques move the arrow different amounts. The goal is to make the top arrow and the bottom arrow align, with the final three techniques you use being the ones specified. If the hammer breaks or the metal cools off, you'll have to start over. If the arrow goes off screen, you'll lose the metal."
